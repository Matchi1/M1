__Under the pressure from the yankees, Google remove Apple and takes Russia down
with a giant roller coaster scenario__

During the first week of September 2050, the most ridiculous event took place in
Russia.
The Yankees, a famous baseball team, invaded the country and managed to utterly
conquer this giant country with a bat and a ball as their main weapon.
What is more surprising is that no casualties are to be declared, neither from
The Yankees, nor from the russiand side.
The baseball team didn't stop there, they also threatened Google to do the same
to the company if they can't remove Apple from the market.
With the giant roller coaster scenario, we can say that The Yankees are now the
ruler of the Earth.
