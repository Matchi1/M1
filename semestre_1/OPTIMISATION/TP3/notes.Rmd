# User specification

Before starting to explore the report, here are some information about how to
execute `generic.py` and `decoupe.py` and the output that are created from the
execution.

## generic.py

The following command executes the lp solver on the input file and redirect the
result into the specified output file.

`python3 generic.py <input file> <output file>`

Some option can be used to have specific actions on the input file.

| option | description                                            |
|:------:+:------------------------------------------------------:|
| -int   | type of all ressources are set to int instead of float |
| -min   | change objective from 'max' to 'min' and '<=' to '>='  |

This script will show all relevant information about the input file.
It will show the number of equation, the number of variable, the list of
solution and the list of all resources and its corresponding coefficient.

This script will produce the following files:

- **result.txt**: summary of the operation
- **output file**: output into lp solver format

## decoupe.py

To execute the split of a bar:

`python3 decoupe.py <maximum size> -l value1 value2 ... -e value1 value2 ...`

| option | description                         |
|:------:+:-----------------------------------:|
| -l     | list of all the possible measures   |
| -e     | number of slicing for each measures |

This script will show the list of all possible combinations for the specified
value on the command line, and the number of combinations.

- **data.txt**: representation of the slicing into the imposed format
- **result.txt**: summary of the operation
- **output file**: output into lp solver format

**NOTE:** the list of all the possible measures and the list of number of
slicing should have the same size.

## Exemples

`python3 generic.py data.txt output.lp`

(see **exercice_6** directory)

`python3 decoupe.py 500 -l 200 120 100 50 -e 60 100 150 350`

(see **exercice_10** directory)

# Exercice 1

Optimal values for x1 and x2 are correspondingly 1.85185 and 9.07407.

# Exercice 2

With **free** we can see the problem is **not bounded** anymore.

# Exercice 3

With the solver, we correctly find 4500.0 for objective function, 20 for x1 and
15 for x2.

# Exercice 4 and 5

see respectively `exercice_4/generic.py` and `exercice_5/generic.py` files.

# Exercice 6

a. The objective function value is : 21654.79332331
b. There are 6 different products that needs to be created.
c. The time spent for the calculation was 25 ms

# Exercice 7

a. The objective function value is : 21638.0
b. There are 12 different products that needs to be created.
c. The time spent for the calculation was 20 s

# Exercice 8

## without -int option

a. The objective function value is : 5050533.10609334
b. There are 11 different products that needs to be created.
c. The time spent for the calculation was 1 s

## with -int option

Took too much time to solve the problem (more than an hour)

# Exercice 9

We actually have 7 ways to split a segment of 3 m and maximize the production.
The table below represents all the possible combinations with the specified
measures.

| 1.20 | 1.0 | 0.5 |
|------+-----+-----|
| 0    | 0   | 6   |
| 4    | 1   | 0   |
| 3    | 0   | 1   |
| 2    | 2   | 0   |
| 1    | 0   | 2   |
| 1    | 1   | 1   |
| 0    | 3   | 0   |

# Exercice 10

See `exercice_10/decoupe.py`

With 500 as the length of the bar and [200, 120, 100, 50] as the list of all
the measurement, 25 combinations are possible.

To verify that our script was correct, we compared the result obtained with
the following data:

- 300 as the maximum length of the board
- 120, 100, 50 as the possible measurement
- 100, 130 300 as the number of element for each measurement

# Exercice 11

We correctly found 114 as the optimum and 4 slicing that are used to maximize the
slicing, which are P1, P12, P23 and P24.

We also tested with the following entries:

- 300 the maximum length
- 120, 100, 50 as the possible mesurement size
- 100, 130 300 as the number of element for each measurement

We found 135 as the optimum and a total of 4 slicing that are used to maximize
the slicing.
