# User specification

## generic.py

The following command executes the lp solver on the input file and redirect the
result into the specified output file.

`python3 generic.py <input file> <output file>`

Some option can be used to have specific actions on the input file.

| option | description                                            |
| -int   | type of all ressources are set to int instead of float |
| -min   | change objective from 'max' to 'min' and '<=' to '>='  |

This script will show all relevant information about the input file.
It will show the number of equation, the number of variable, the list of
solution and the list of all resources and its corresponding coefficient.

## decoupe.py

To execute the split of a bar:

`python3 decoupe.py <maximum size> -l [list of measurement]`

This script will show the list of all possible combinations for the specified
value on the command line, and the number of combinations.

# Exercice 1

Optimal values for x1 and x2 are correspondingly 1.85185 and 9.07407.

# Exercice 2

With **free** we can see the problem is not bounded anymore.

# Exercice 3

With the solver, we correctly find 4500.0 for objective function, 20 for x1 and
15 for x2.

# Exercice 4

see `exercice_4/generic.py` file.

# Exercice 5

see `exercice_5/generic.py` file.

# Exercice 6

a. The objective function value is : 21654.79332331
b. There are 6 different product that needs to be created.
c. The time spent for the calculation was 25 ms

# Exercice 7

a. The objective function value is : 21638.0
b. There are 12 different product that needs to be created.
c. The time spent for the calculation was 20 s

# Exercice 8

## without -int option

a. The objective function value is : 5050533.10609334
b. There are ? different product that needs to be created.
c. The time spent for the calculation was 1 s

## with -int option

Took too much time to solve problem (more than an hour)

# Exercice 9

We have actually 7 ways to split a segment of 3 m and maximize the production.
The table below represents all the possible combinations with the specified
measures.

| 1.20 | 1.0 | 0.5 |
|------+-----+-----|
| 0    | 0   | 6   |
| 4    | 1   | 0   |
| 3    | 0   | 1   |
| 2    | 2   | 0   |
| 1    | 0   | 2   |
| 1    | 1   | 1   |
| 0    | 3   | 0   |

# Exercice 10

See `exercice_10/decoupe.py`

With 500 as the length of the bar and [200, 120, 100, 50] as the list of all
the measurement, 25 combinations are possible.

# Exercice 11
